    "Resume Summarization using Ollama\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project processes resumes and generates concise summaries using Ollama with a locally running LLM (Llama3.2 or other supported models). It allows users to extract key highlights from resumes without relying on external API calls like OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "==================================\n",
    "Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses Ollama for local inference (no API key required).\n",
    "Extracts and summarizes resume content.\n",
    "Supports Llama3.2, Mistral, or other compatible models.\n",
    "No internet connection required after the model is downloaded.\n",
    "Installation & Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Ollama\n",
    "If Ollama is not installed, download it from the official site or install it via terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n",
    "2. Pull a Model\n",
    "You need to download a model before running the script. Choose one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "ollama pull llama3\n",
    "ollama pull mistral\n",
    "To list all available models:\n",
    "\n",
    "ollama list\n",
    "3. Install Python Dependencies (if required)\n",
    "Ensure you have Python installed (â‰¥3.7) and set up the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "==========================================\n",
    "If using a virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "python -m venv ollama_env\n",
    "source ollama_env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux\n",
    "ollama_env\\Scripts\\activate  # On Windows\n",
    "Then, install any required packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install ollama\n",
    "Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the script to generate a summarized resume:\n",
    "\n",
    "python resume_summarizer.py\n",
    "Code Explanation\n",
    "Resume text is provided as input.\n",
    "Ollama processes the resume using a local model.\n",
    "A concise summary is generated and displayed."
